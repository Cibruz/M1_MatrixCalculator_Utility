# Identifying Features
* Matrix Scalar Multiplication
* Matrix Addition
* Matrix Multiplication
* Matrix Transpose
* Determine the RREF of a Matrix (Reduced Row Echelon Form)
* Find the Determinant of a Matrix
* Inverse a Matrix

## State of Art/Research
* The operation on the matrix can save a lot of time. 
* Playing with number of matrixes.
* And perform many funstions/methods to get result

# 4W's and 1H
## Why
* To make the calculations easy 
## What
* Matrix : 2D array of elements. and calculator is for the arithematic operations between them. 
## Who
* ME
## Where 
* Learned in the 12th Class
## How
* By the methods learned in 12th

# SWOT Analysis of Matrix Calculator
## STRENGTHS
* All the arithematic operation possible form the two or more matrixes can be performed by the matrix Calculator.
## WEAKNESS
* Since the operations of matrixes depend on each other like, for determinent, Transpose etc. you need the multiplication to be correct of t=one part of the program gets error it will effedt the whole process. Some of them depend on each other.
## OPPORTUNITIES
* The number of matrixes can be operated or solved as fast as possible can help in the area where the organization play with the matrixes on the daily basis, a lot of time will be conserved in this department.
## THREATS
* None. 

# HIGH Level Requirements
* Number of matrix
* Matrix
* Operation required to perform

# LOW Level Requirements
* Matrix elements sequence-wise
* Operation number from the list

# Best Methods Followed
